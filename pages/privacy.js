          Privacy Policy shall also apply to Midas cellular and web applications
          (“Apps”).

        <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          Midas uses reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative
          procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized
          access, use, or disclosure. Midas supports online security using
          secure server technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have implemented policies and procedures designed to secure your
          personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
          access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Midas uses a combination of
          physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in accordance with
          applicable Federal and State laws. Data transfer, storage, and
          integrity for personal information are secured and transmitted via
          secure encryption technology, regular data backups, and key code
          authentication. Midas utilizes Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          encryption that meets Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
          to provide the most secure connection between your computer and our
          websites. To verify the security of your connection, you may click on
          the ESET lock in the URL bar at the top of this page at any time and
          see information related to the certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where
          we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to
          any Midas website or service, you are responsible for keeping your
          password confidential. It is vital that you not share your password
          with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in
          public areas of any Midas website or service like message boards. The
          information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of
          these services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and
          mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to
          protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of
          your personal information transmitted to or through any Midas website
          or service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own
          risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings
          or security measures we provide.

        </p>

        <p>
          When you download, register with, or use our products, services, Apps,
          or websites, you may be asked to provide us with personal information.
          In the last twelve months, the personal information we may have
          collected falls into the below categories:

            and exercise data;
          </li>
          <li>

            drug test, credit check, or any other screening requirement for
            which you consented in order to gain employment
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HOW MIDAS MAY USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          By providing Midas with your resume and completing an application, you
          authorize Midas to collect, use, store, transfer, and purge the

          We may potentially, and only as applicable and appropriate, disclose

            address to our subsidiaries and third-party service providers who
            can use it to identify your state and zip code. This gives us
            valuable demographic information about the individuals who visit our
            website or use our services.
          </li>
          <li>
            To our subsidiaries and affiliates: We may share personal
            information with our affiliates. Our affiliates will use and share
            your personal information only as set forth in this Privacy Policy
            and in accordance with applicable law;
          </li>
          <li>
            As part of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal
            information to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger,
            divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other
            sale or transfer of some or all of Midas assets, whether as a going

            proceeding, in which personal information held by Midas about our
            Website or Service’s users is among the assets transferred. If such
            a transfer occurs, the successor organization’s use of your personal
            information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy and any

            purposes for which we disclose it to them;
          </li>
          <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it;</li>
          <li>
            For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the
            information: We reserve the right to disclose your personal
            information as described in any privacy policy or click-through
            agreement posted on a page of our services where you provide that
            information. By providing your personal information on that page you
            will be consenting to the disclosure of your personal information as
            described in that privacy policy; and/or
          </li>

          In-Sight product through Aha!, we may also ask for your credit card
          number or other account number you wish to be charged. We do not give
          out your credit card or other account information to third parties
          unless you authorize us to do so or if it is necessary to fulfill our
          responsibilities, including, but not limited to, delivering a product
          or service you order. We currently use a third party vendor to process
          online payments. In addition to a credit card number or account
          information, they may also request your name, cardholder’s name,
          billing address, phone number, and email address. While making these
          purchases for products or services, this Privacy Policy will not apply
          and the transaction and collection will be governed by the third
          party’s privacy policy and/or terms of use.

          your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen
          name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or
          received personal information from a child under 18, we will delete
          that information. If you believe we might have any information from or

        <h2>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
        <p>
          Your personal information may be collected, transferred to, and stored
          by us in the United States and by our affiliates in other countries
          where we operate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, your personal information may be processed outside the
          European Economic Area (EEA), and in countries which are not subject
          to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not
          provide for the same level of data protection in the EEA. In this
          event, we will ensure that such recipient offers an adequate level of
          protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses
          for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art.
          46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such
          international data transfers.
        </p>
        <h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>
          We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
          changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, and other
          factors. If we do, we will update the “effective date” at the top of
          this Privacy Policy. If we make a significant update, we may provide
          you with notice prior to the update taking effect, such as by posting
          a conspicuous notice on our website or by contacting you using the
          email address you provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay
          informed about our collection, processing and sharing of your personal
          information.
